IDEA:
The main idea of the game is a puzzle game where the player is a ball and is inside a labyrinth. The main objective is to get to the end of the labyrinth while avoiding the hazards of the level.

Core Mechanics:

To move the Ball we use the Wii Balance Board to change the rotation of the maze, via a program (https://github.com/lshachar/Wiibalancewalker/releases) that translates the change in the barycenter of the player in a keyboard command.
In this game demo, there are 3 levels that are procedurally generated to keep the player engaged. Each level has different powerups that temporarily help find the exit of the maze. Also, there are coins that the player has to collect in order to finish the level when it arrives at the exit.  But the player has to pay attention to the holes scattered around the level that can destroy the ball. In each playthrough, the player has 3 life  if lost the game is over and the player returns to the menu.
Also, the player can customize his ball in the shop menu  and see its high score in the high score menu.
