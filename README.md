#####IDEA#######
The main idea of the game is a puzzle game where the player is a ball and is inside a labyrinth. The main objective is to get to the end of the labyrinth in the least time possible!

####Core Mechanics#####

To move the Ball we use the Wii Balance Board, via a program that translates the change in the barycenter of the player in keyboard command-> the main way to move the ball. This is done using the driver form https://github.com/lshachar/Wiibalancewalker/releases. 
(Or to move the plane where the game is with the balance and the ball with the Physics moves in relation to the inclination of the board)
The walls of the game are procedurally generated so we can create a wall to move around and arrive at the destination.
to resarch how to procedurally create a labirint in 3D.
