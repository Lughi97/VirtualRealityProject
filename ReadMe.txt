#### UNITY PROJECT WII BALANCE BOARD #####
#### GAME TITLE #######

#####IDEA#######
The main idea of the game is a puzzle game where the player is a ball and is inside a labyrinth. The main objective is to get to the end of the labyrinth in the least time possible!

####Core Mechanics#####

To move the Ball we use the Wii Balance Board, via a program that translates the change in the barycenter of the player. 
The walls of the game are procedurally generated so we can create a wall to move around and to arrive at the destination.
